# Happiness Quotient

The Happiness Quotient displays a filtered image of records, as a percentage, of the total number of records based on some two-level filter criteria, which you define on dashboards and reports, subsequently indicating the progress of the record set. On the view panel, it displays the progress made on a particular record based on the field you have specified.

### Using the Happiness Quotient Widget on Dashboards or Report Pages

An example of using the Happiness Quotient widget on the dashboard or reports page would be displaying the alert records as a percentage of alert records to indicate the progress of the alert record set as per the following filter criteria:

- Created on or earlier than 7 days
- Severity set to 'High' or 'Critical' 

This defines the first criteria, i.e., the criterion that determines the total number of records to be considered. For example, if there are 500 alert records in your system, applying these filter criteria could bring the number of alerts down to `58` alerts. These `58` alerts would be considered as the total number of records on which an additional filter where *State* is *Investigating* is set; defining the subset of records that are ultimately displayed in the Happiness Quotient image on the dashboard or reports page.

### Using the Happiness Quotient Widget on the View Panel

An example of using the Happiness Quotient widget on the View Panel would be monitoring the progress, as a percentage, for a particular incident record based on a selected field and the set minimum and maximum values. 

> **NOTE**: The chosen field for monitoring the progress must be of type *Integer* or *Number*. The minimum and maximum values of the field (if set) are retrieved from the database. The values must not be negative.
>

For example, if you want to view the progress made on an incident record based on the time that record has spent in the *Containment* phase, you can select the input field as *Containment Time (in minutes)* and specify the minimum time (in minutes), for example, `0`, and maximum time (in minutes), for example, `480`. Now, if the record has its *Containment Time (in minutes)* field set as `120`, the  Happiness Quotient widget displays 25%.
